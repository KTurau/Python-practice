# In a file called professor.py, implement a program that:

# Prompts the user for a level, n. If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
# Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with n digits.
# No need to support operations other than addition (+).
# Prompts the user to solve each of those problem. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt
# the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should
# output the correct answer.
# The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score, a number out of 10.

# Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a level and returns 1, 2, or 3,
# and generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:
